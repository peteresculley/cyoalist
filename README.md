# cyoalist
A safe useful tool for CYOAs. For filling them out, saving and sharing builds.

You need to be in "edit" mode to make changes to anything.
Pressing the "Escape" key will toggle "edit" mode on/off.

It automatically saves the current build into the browser every 5 seconds.
You can load from the browser's storage by using "Import from storage".

You can only load json builds that were exported as json.
Exporting as Human readable is only for reading and sharing. You cannot load them again from the human readable format.
